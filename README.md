# STM32-timers-uart-low-power-rtc-can

This repository contains an application for STM32F401 and STM32F429 microcontrollers that leverages the device's timers, UART interface, Controller Area Network (CAN) module, and real-time clock (RTC) module. The project has low-power applications and includes sample code for configuring and using the timers, UART interface, CAN module, and RTC module. The code is written in C and includes detailed comments and explanations to facilitate understanding and modification. Additionally, the repository includes examples of CAN communication between two STM32 devices.

## Installation

To use these drivers in your project, simply clone this repository into your project directory:


You can then include the relevant driver files in your project and configure them according to your needs.


## Contributing

## Acknowledgements

This library was inspired by the course Mastering Microcontroller with Embedded Driver Development on Udemy, and was modified to work with the STM32F401RE-STM32429I microcontrollers. I would like to thank the instructor of the course for providing a clear and concise explanation of the concepts, and for helping me get started with writing drivers for microcontrollers.
